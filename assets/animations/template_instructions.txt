ANIMATION FRAME TEMPLATES GUIDE

This guide provides specific pixel-level modification instructions for creating animation frames from base sprites.

== WALKING ANIMATION TEMPLATES ==

For all walking frames, follow these general patterns:

Walk Frame 1 (Neutral position):
- Base standing pose
- Legs together or slightly apart
- Arms at sides
- Head facing forward

Walk Frame 2 (Left step):
- Left leg forward by 2-3 pixels
- Right leg back by 2-3 pixels
- Slight lean forward (shift upper body 1 pixel)
- Arms in slight swing position (left arm back, right arm forward)

Walk Frame 3 (Right step):
- Right leg forward by 2-3 pixels
- Left leg back by 2-3 pixels
- Slight lean forward (shift upper body 1 pixel)
- Arms in opposite swing position (right arm back, left arm forward)

== TALKING ANIMATION TEMPLATES ==

For talking animations, only modify the mouth area:

Talk Frame 1 (Mouth closed):
- Use base sprite as reference
- Ensure mouth is in closed/neutral position

Talk Frame 2 (Mouth open):
- Copy Talk Frame 1 exactly
- Modify only the mouth area:
  - Open mouth by 1-2 pixels
  - Create a small dark area representing the open mouth
  - Do not change any other facial features

== CHARACTER-SPECIFIC NOTES ==

Jake:
- Modify his hat position slightly during walking frames
- Keep his tool belt aligned with movement
- Maintain his scruffy beard appearance in talking frames

Lila:
- Her notepad should stay in her hand across all frames
- Her glasses should remain in the same position
- Her ponytail can have subtle movement in walking frames

== PIXEL ART TIPS ==

1. Work at 400% zoom minimum for precision
2. Use the pencil tool with no anti-aliasing
3. Work with individual pixels for clean edges
4. Test animations by toggling between frames
5. Make backup copies before modifying existing sprites
