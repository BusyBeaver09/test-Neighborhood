# Timeline Puzzle UI for Maplewood Lane

A drag-and-drop timeline puzzle interface that integrates with the Maplewood Lane puzzle system.

## üìã Overview

This package contains a working prototype for the Timeline Puzzle UI, which allows players to:

1. View a set of timeline events/clues
2. Drag and drop them into the correct chronological order
3. Submit their solution for validation
4. Receive feedback and rewards

The implementation integrates with the existing `PuzzleManager` and `PuzzleRenderer` classes, providing a seamless experience within the main game.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Quick Demo

To see the Timeline Puzzle UI in action:

1. Open `timeline-puzzle-ui.html` in your browser for a standalone demo
2. Open `timeline-integrated.html` for a demo that integrates with the game's puzzle system

### Files Included

- `timeline-puzzle-ui.html` - Standalone prototype
- `timeline-integrated.html` - Integration with PuzzleManager
- `timeline-puzzle.js` - Enhanced timeline features
- `timeline-puzzle-readme.md` - This documentation

                time: "10:00 AM",
                text: "Description of first event"
            },

                text: "Description of second event"
            },
            // Add more events as needed
