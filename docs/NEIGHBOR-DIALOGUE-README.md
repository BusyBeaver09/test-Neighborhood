# Neighbor Personalities & Dialogue System

A powerful, personality-driven dialogue system for the narrative exploration game "Maplewood Lane: Neighborhood Mysteries" that makes characters feel distinct, memorable, and reactive to player choices.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë System Overview

This dialogue system allows for:

1. **Trust-based dialogue changes** - Different text based on trust level
2. **Personality-driven responses** - Characters react according to their traits
3. **Condition-based dialogues** - Show specific dialogues based on trust, clues, time of day, etc.
4. **Branching conversations** - Player choices affect trust and story progression
5. **Dynamic dialogue unlocking** - New conversation options as the player discovers clues

## üë• Character Personality System

### Strong Character Archetypes

Each character has:

- **Archetype**: Base personality (e.g., "Nosy Elder", "Guilty Teen")
- **Hidden Layer**: Secret revealed at high trust 
- **Trust Thresholds**: 4 levels of revelations (0-24, 25-49, 50-74, 75+)
- **Personality Traits**: Affect dialogue style and behavior (e.g., "secretive", "anxious")

### Trust-Based Dialogue Evolution

Characters reveal more information and change their tone as trust increases:

```
Trust < 10:
JAKE: "Why do you care? She's gone. People move on."

Trust 25‚Äì50:
JAKE: "We were close, okay? I just... don't want to talk about it here."

Trust ‚â• 75:
JAKE: "She didn't run. Someone scared her. Maybe it was me. I don't know anymore."
```

### Personality Trait Effects

Character traits affect dialogue style:

- **Secretive**: Vague responses at low trust
- **Anxious**: More agitated dialogue at night
- **Superstitious**: References to "signs" and "fate" rather than coincidences
- **Protective**: Will lie to protect others, creating contradictions to find
